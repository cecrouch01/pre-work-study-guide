          <li>HTML is the structure of the content of a webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>There are other elements like sections as well</li>

        <h2>CSS
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Programming language used for defining how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style elementals directly, they apply to specific HTML tags</li>
          <li>Interal Style Sheets contain CSS rules in the head section, not the body.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style sheet is the most used method because it keeps all CSS rules ina  separate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important compontents, property and value</li>
          <li>Multiple declarations can be in a selector and are called declaration blocks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript
        </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Java is a tool that takes static HTML/CSS and makes it interactive</li>
            <li>Every time you do something with a webpage, even as simple as clicking a button, java is a work</li>
            <li>To declare a variable you use the var keyword. Then give the variable a name</li>
            <li>The equal sign is used to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
            <li>A String is contained within a quotation mark and is a list of the variables</li>
            <li>Javascript is linear, the order in which you put things matters</li>
            <li>Javascript has conditional statements and loops to cycle through code</li>
            <li>If statements are first checked to be truthy and if they are then the statement in the brackets will happen</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that used to hold a group of data, which is usually related</li>
            <li>Arrays are useful for storing multiple itesm with different data. However, not all arrays have different data</li>
            <li>To work with individual items inside an array, we need the location of the data item in the array. This location has a unique id called an index</li>
            <li>Many programming languages are zero indexed, where zero is the first number in a sequence</li>
            <li>Loops help with large arrays</li>
            <li>A FOR loop uses a predictible patteren of indices to execute a single code of block repeatedly. A conditional if statement can interrupt the control flow so a block of code only executes a specific amount of times</li>
            <li>A FOR loop contains a starting point for our loop, a condition, and a statement allowing arrays to iterate over each item</li>
